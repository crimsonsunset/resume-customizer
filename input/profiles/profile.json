    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile! My journey in technology began at a young age when I laid my hands on my first HP. After obtaining my computer science degree, I dove headfirst into the rapidly changing world of web development. With hands-on coding experience spanning over a decade across Fortune 500 companies like Disney and industry leaders like iCIMS, I've had the privilege of working on exciting applications that span the gamut of what technology can achieve. From Webby Award-winning, design-forward content to enterprise-grade SaaS products, I find fulfillment in navigating the diverse technical complexities each project brings. In the more recent years of my career, I've led teams that have developed Stevie Award-winning HR technology. Whether it was integrating new technologies into existing systems or guiding junior developers to become high-performing professionals, I focus on building both great products and great people. You can hear the details directly from those I've worked with in the recommendations section! At FORA (my most recent role), I've had the unique opportunity to pioneer AI-assisted development practices when the technology was still in its infancy. I transformed experimental cursor-driven workflows into battle-tested methodologies that became the blueprint for how the engineering team could reliably harness AI for production development. My leadership philosophy is simple: great engineering happens when you remove friction and let talented people do what they do best. I focus on eliminating process bottlenecks, automating repetitive work, and creating systems that let my teams move fast without breaking things. The result is faster delivery because people spend time solving problems, not fighting processes or navigating office politics. Whether you're building engineering teams, exploring AI-assisted development, or have an innovative product idea that needs both strategic vision and hands-on execution, reach out at jsangio1@gmail.com—I'd love to connect!

We collaborate regularly on various projects and have bi-weekly one-on-one meetings since she started her role at iCIMS. Elyza is an active knowledge seeker who is not satisfied with just meeting the status quo. She seeks out internal training resources and obtains external certifications to further her professional growth. Notably, she has earned the \"User Experience Interaction Design\" certification from Nielsen Norman Group and the \"Google UX Design\" certificate from Coursera. I like to think of Elyza as a professional superhero of sorts. Front-end developer by day, UX designer/artist by night. To cap it off, she is a talented musical and digital artist, with a prolific portfolio! Examples of her work are publically abundant, but I recommend starting with her Youtube or Socials. Elyza is passionate about accessibility and language; she has gone above and beyond to optimize our software for both initiatives. She conducts thorough audits of our applications, ensuring seamless accessibility for all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Her dedication to inclusivity is inspiring. She is personally involved with the \"Women Who Code\" organization and serves as the voice of these viewpoints on our team. She has the potential to make significant contributions to advancing inclusive software development. In addition to Elyza's technical skills and creative abilities, her personality and character make her an ideal candidate. She is easy to work with, outgoing, and always willing to lend a helping hand. Elyza reduces barriers by seeking support and asking for help when needed. Her ability to ask thoughtful questions allows her to clarify any concerns or confusion, ensuring that she completes tasks accurately and efficiently. Elyza's passion, combined with her range of abilities and remarkable dedication to inclusivity, make her an excellent prospect for any engineering or design teams.",

She is able to evaluate our deployed services and provides meaningful suggestions on how to make them better. She has no problem taking ownership of the products she works on. Narmadha is able to thrive in both individual and group settings. She has purposeful conversations with our product managers to understand all of our customer requirements. Once tickets are created, she works to deliver software that meets/exceeds those goals. Additionally, she has recently taken on new responsibilities to help mentor developers in our H-Lab program. She provides technical guidance, leadership, and also helps to get them onboarded and up to speed on different parts of our stack.

Although Boris is mostly removed from IC work at this point in his career, he still maintains a high technical acumen and ability.

If you ask anyone on our development team who knows a little bit of everything in the tech stack, the answer is invariably Boris. Additionally, Boris is extremely passionate about his job. He is interested in delivering a superior product across the board, and keeping the organization running in an optimal fashion. He clearly loves the work he does, and the people he works with. Speaking as one of his direct reports, I appreciate the candor I can have with him in all our interactions. I never feel like I have to \"pull punches\" which makes it easier and faster to get work done together. He is extremely receptive to ideas I bring up in our discussions and has been effective at putting them into practice. Finally, Boris has been a great mentor and has taught me what it takes to be a strong leader. He is knowledgeable in dealing with various managerial situations that may arise and helping coach through these types of events. I regularly learn from his techniques, and value our discussions around these points.

He is charismatic, funny, and able to connect on a personal level with his cohorts. Although most software engineers I’ve worked with lean more towards the reserved side, Josh bucks this trend and is a lively participant in any group setting. Josh is a leader in modernizing our NodeJS application layer. He fought to utilize cutting-edge frameworks (like NestJS) which brings TypeScript and observables to this part of the codebase. He dedicated many cycles to integrating object oriented concepts that greatly improved organization at this level of our stack. Additionally, he refined our caching mechanism, providing speed and performance gains that benefited our customers. He continues to strive towards writing testable, maintainable code.

Elliot used his astute observational skills to spot problem areas of our editorial team's workflows. From here, he was able to create thoughtful software solutions to boost efficiency in these areas. By the time I was on-boarded to his projects, Elliot had created well-written, clearly defined user stories that were extremely easy to decipher and work through. He thoughtfully separated stories into digestible chunks and allowed the developers to fill in the gaps with their own creativity. When the initial proposed solutions needed to be adjusted, he was very willing to work through alternatives to find a happy medium.

He learned Sass on the job, and shortly therafter was able to produce production-ready code heavily utilizing it. After proving himself in the Sass rewrite project, Ben was added as a key developer on our internal promo creation tool team. The project went through three [drastically different] phases, transitioning from jQuery to ES5-style ReactJS, and finally to ES6 [class based] ReactJS. To tackle this gargantuan effort, Ben spent hours steeped in online resources, working alongside fellow engineers, and coding side projects that utilized the framework. Once he felt comfortable with all of this brand new technology, Ben jumped in head-first. He was able to effectively handle bug fixes, major stylistic changes, and even created some of the app's most complex components from scratch. He also assisted with deciphering and stabilizing the webpack configuration for the project, which leveraged a complex build chain. He was vital to the project's success, and instrumental in coding one of the company's cleanest, most current/future-facing codebases. Ben is wise beyond his age.
