    "summary": "Hello, and thank you for visiting my profile! My journey in technology began at a young age when I laid my hands on my first HP. After obtaining my computer science degree, I dove headfirst into the rapidly changing world of web development. With hands-on coding experience spanning over a decade across Fortune 500 companies like Disney and industry leaders like iCIMS, I've had the privilege of working on exciting applications that span the gamut of what technology can achieve. From Webby Award-winning, design-forward content to enterprise-grade SaaS products, I find fulfillment in navigating the diverse technical complexities each project brings. In the more recent years of my career, I've led teams that have developed Stevie Award-winning HR technology. Whether it was integrating new technologies into existing systems or guiding junior developers to become high-performing professionals, I focus on building both great products and great people. You can hear the details directly from those I've worked with in the recommendations section! At FORA (my most recent role), I've had the unique opportunity to pioneer AI-assisted development practices when the technology was still in its infancy. I transformed experimental cursor-driven workflows into battle-tested methodologies that became the blueprint for how the engineering team could reliably harness AI for production development. My leadership philosophy is simple: great engineering happens when you remove friction and let talented people do what they do best. I focus on eliminating process bottlenecks, automating repetitive work, and creating systems that let my teams move fast without breaking things. The result is faster delivery because people spend time solving problems, not fighting processes or navigating office politics. Whether you're building engineering teams, exploring AI-assisted development, or have an innovative product idea that needs both strategic vision and hands-on execution, reach out at jsangio1@gmail.com—I'd love to connect!
