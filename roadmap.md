## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Major Architecture Changes

#### WeasyPrint → Playwright Migration (July 2025)
**Decision:** Replace WeasyPrint with Playwright for PDF generation  
**Reasoning:** 
- WeasyPrint lacks CSS Grid support (critical for modern layouts)
- Playwright provides full modern CSS feature support
- Better rendering quality with headless Chrome engine
- Pixel-perfect output matching browser display
- Faster performance (1-3 seconds vs slower WeasyPrint)

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Complete CSS Grid support achieved
- ✅ Modern CSS features now available (Flexbox, custom properties, etc.)
- ✅ Better PDF quality and file size efficiency
- ✅ Consistent cross-platform rendering
- ✅ Future-proof architecture supporting web standards

#### HTML Structure Strategy
**Decision:** Use semantic HTML5 with meaningful CSS classes  
**Reasoning:** 
- Google Docs export creates unmaintainable cryptic classes
- Semantic structure improves maintainability and version control
- Modern CSS capabilities enable sophisticated layouts
- Better accessibility and screen reader support

**Implementation:**
- Clean HTML structure with `<header>`, `<section>`, semantic elements
- CSS Grid for professional two-column layout
- Meaningful class names (`.section-label`, `.section-content`)
- Print-optimized CSS with proper page break handling

### Performance Benchmarks
- **WeasyPrint:** 15-17KB PDFs (incomplete, truncated content)
- **Playwright Basic:** 143KB PDFs (complete content, no styling)
- **Playwright + CSS Grid:** 204KB PDFs (complete content, professional styling)
- **Generation Time:** 1-3 seconds consistently
- **Quality:** Pixel-perfect matching Chrome browser output

#### UI Framework Selection (January 2025)
**Decision:** shadcn-svelte for web application interface  
**Reasoning:**
- Headless components (Bits UI) with beautiful default styling
- Zero CSS conflicts with existing resume styles
- Excellent theming system with 30+ built-in themes
- Component-based architecture - install only needed components
- CSS variable system for easy customization
- Professional theme builder tools available

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Melt UI: Too much manual styling required
- Bits UI: Great foundation but no default styles
- DaisyUI: Potential CSS conflicts with resume styling
- Full frameworks: Overkill for single-page application

**CSS Isolation Strategy:**
- Scoped CSS containers (`.web-ui` vs `.resume-container`)
- No global CSS resets or conflicting styles
- Resume layout completely protected from UI framework

### Future Technology Considerations
- **Print CSS Standards:** Leveraging @media print for optimal PDF output
- **CSS Container Queries:** For advanced responsive layouts (future)
- **CSS Subgrid:** Enhanced grid capabilities when widely supported
- **Web Components:** Potential modular resume section components
