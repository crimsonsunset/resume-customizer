## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Major Architecture Changes

#### WeasyPrint → Playwright Migration (July 2025)
**Decision:** Replace WeasyPrint with Playwright for PDF generation  
**Reasoning:** 
- WeasyPrint lacks CSS Grid support (critical for modern layouts)
- Playwright provides full modern CSS feature support
- Better rendering quality with headless Chrome engine
- Pixel-perfect output matching browser display
- Faster performance (1-3 seconds vs slower WeasyPrint)

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Complete CSS Grid support achieved
- ✅ Modern CSS features now available (Flexbox, custom properties, etc.)
- ✅ Better PDF quality and file size efficiency
- ✅ Consistent cross-platform rendering
- ✅ Future-proof architecture supporting web standards

#### HTML Structure Strategy
**Decision:** Use semantic HTML5 with meaningful CSS classes  
**Reasoning:** 
- Google Docs export creates unmaintainable cryptic classes
- Semantic structure improves maintainability and version control
- Modern CSS capabilities enable sophisticated layouts
- Better accessibility and screen reader support

**Implementation:**
- Clean HTML structure with `<header>`, `<section>`, semantic elements
- CSS Grid for professional two-column layout
- Meaningful class names (`.section-label`, `.section-content`)
- Print-optimized CSS with proper page break handling

### Performance Benchmarks
- **WeasyPrint:** 15-17KB PDFs (incomplete, truncated content)
- **Playwright Basic:** 143KB PDFs (complete content, no styling)
- **Playwright + CSS Grid:** 204KB PDFs (complete content, professional styling)
- **Generation Time:** 1-3 seconds consistently
- **Quality:** Pixel-perfect matching Chrome browser output

#### UI Framework Selection (July 2025)
**Decision:** SvelteKit + DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS 4 for web application interface  
**Reasoning:**
- SvelteKit provides full-stack SSR capabilities with excellent performance
- DaisyUI offers 30+ professional themes with excellent component library
- Tailwind CSS 4 provides modern styling with proper scoping capabilities
- Server-side rendering with Svelte `render()` function for dynamic content
- Component-based architecture with proper CSS isolation

**Alternatives Considered:**
- shadcn-svelte: Great but more complex setup
- Melt UI: Too much manual styling required
- Bits UI: Great foundation but no default styles
- Full frameworks: Overkill for single-page application

**CSS Isolation Strategy:**
- Scoped CSS containers (`.web-ui` vs `.resume-container`)
- Static asset serving for resume CSS (separate from Tailwind)
- Resume layout completely protected from UI framework styles

#### Preset System Architecture (July 2025)
**Decision:** Partial preset files with smart merge logic  
**Reasoning:**
- Lightweight preset definitions that only specify differences
- Preserves raw data integrity while allowing customization
- Fallback to raw data when presets are missing or malformed
- URL parameter control for easy preset switching
- Extensible system for multiple preset types

**Implementation Details:**
- Preset files in `input/profiles/presets/` directory
- Merge logic in `src/shared/preset-merger.js`
- Server-side preset application in `+page.server.js`
- Component-level preset handling in Svelte components

#### Component Architecture (July 2025)
**Decision:** Svelte server-side rendering with section components  
**Reasoning:**
- Server-side rendering provides better performance and SEO
- Component-based architecture allows for modular resume sections
- Helper functions within components for complex logic
- Svelte `render()` function enables dynamic HTML generation
- Maintains separation of concerns between data and presentation

**Component Structure:**
- One component per resume section (header, objective, experience, skills)
- Helper functions for filtering, formatting, and categorization
- Props-based data passing for flexibility
- Server-side rendering for initial page load

#### Section Priority Architecture (July 2025)
**Decision:** Default priorities in profile.json with preset override capability  
**Reasoning:**
- Follows existing default + override pattern used for other configurations
- Enables future "target audience" feature to modify priorities
- Allows presets to fine-tune section importance for specific scenarios
- Provides sensible defaults that work out of the box
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing preset system

**Implementation Details:**
- Section priorities (1-100 scale) stored in profile.json resume_config
- Must-have sections (Experience, Education, Skills) = 90-100 priority
- Enhancement sections (Volunteering, Activities, Recommendations) = 40-70 priority
- Projects = 10 priority (important content but cuttable for space)
- Preset files can override specific section priorities via section_priorities object
- Merge logic in preset-merger.js handles priority inheritance

#### Two-Tier Filtering Strategy (July 2025)
**Decision:** Section-level + bullet-level filtering with single density control  
**Reasoning:**
- Provides maximum content reduction with single user control
- Maintains content quality by filtering at appropriate granularity levels
- Section priorities prevent accidental removal of critical information
- Bullet priorities ensure most impactful content survives filtering
- Scales from full resume (100%) to essential-only resume (10-20%)

**Architecture:**
- filterBullets() function already exists for bullet-level filtering
- New section filtering logic compares density vs section priority
- URL state management supports both manual and density modes
- Stats component recalculates based on filtered output
- Visual feedback shows which content is hidden vs visible

### Future Technology Considerations
- **Print CSS Standards:** Leveraging @media print for optimal PDF output
- **CSS Container Queries:** For advanced responsive layouts (future)
- **CSS Subgrid:** Enhanced grid capabilities when widely supported
- **Web Components:** Potential modular resume section components

## 🔧 Future Technical Improvements

### Code Quality & Consistency Improvements

#### Lodash-es Migration (Audit Complete - December 2025)
**Goal:** Replace native JavaScript methods with lodash-es for improved consistency, readability, and reliability

**Audit Results:** ~100+ native method calls identified for potential lodash replacement

**Implementation Phases:**

**Phase 1: High-Impact Replacements (Priority)**
- Object utilities (15+ occurrences): `Object.keys()` → `keys()`, `Object.values()` → `values()`, `Object.entries()` → `entries()`
- Array filtering & transformation (50+ occurrences): Complex `.filter().map()` chains → `compact()` + functional patterns
- Deep cloning (3 occurrences): `structuredClone()` → `cloneDeep()`, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` → `cloneDeep()`
- **Files**: `SectionControls.svelte`, `skills-renderer.js`, `url-state-manager.js`, `date-utils.js`, `update-dates.js`

**Phase 2: Medium-Impact Replacements**
- String utilities (10+ occurrences): `.toLowerCase()` → `toLower()`, `.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + .slice(1)` → `capitalize()`
- Array utilities (20+ occurrences): `.includes()` → `includes()`, `.find()` → `find()`, `.sort()` → `sortBy()`
- Type checking (10+ occurrences): `Array.isArray()` → `isArray()`, `typeof` checks → `isString()`, `isObject()`
- **Files**: `resume-generator.js`, various renderers, `PresetSelector.svelte`

**Phase 3: Code Style Improvements**
- Collection iteration (15+ occurrences): `for...of` loops → `forEach()`, `map()`, `reduce()`
- Manual loops: `Object.entries().forEach()` → `forOwn()`, `mapValues()`
- Array building patterns: `.push()` operations → `concat()`, `union()`
- **Files**: Multiple renderers, `preset-merger.js`, utility files

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Uniform API across all data manipulation
- **Readability**: More expressive functional programming patterns  
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested utility functions with edge case handling
- **Performance**: Optimized implementations for common operations
- **Maintainability**: Reduced cognitive load with familiar lodash patterns

**Current Status:** Currently using `delay()` from lodash-es (3 files), ready for systematic expansion

**Estimated Impact:** Improve code quality across ~20 files, reduce native method complexity by 60%+

- **Current Role Handling** - Treat ongoing roles (no `endDate`) as current date
- **Renderer Integration** - Add `filterByYears()` method to ExperienceRenderer and ProjectsRenderer
- **Safeguard Logic** - Ensure temporal filter doesn't remove ALL content (profile validation)

#### UI/UX Design
- **Slider Range**: Last 1 year → Last 3 years → Last 5 years → Last 7 years → Last 10 years → All experience
- **Default Setting**: 7 years (optimal balance of career progression vs recency)
- **Visual Metaphor**: 👶 (recent) to 👴 (all experience) icons
- **Placement**: Adjacent to density slider for complementary filtering controls
- **Real-time Updates**: Live preview of filtered content as slider moves

#### Integration Considerations
- **Density + Years Filtering**: Two-layer filtering system (temporal first, then density within remaining content)
- **Preset Interaction**: Future phase - how presets interact with temporal filtering
- **URL State Management**: Extend existing URL state to include years parameter
