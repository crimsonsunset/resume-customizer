# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

## 🎯 Current Status

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - Must Fix Before Next Session

#### ❌ Preset Navigation Infinite Loop
**Status:** BROKEN - App freezes when switching presets  
**Priority:** HIGH - Core navigation feature  
**Last Attempted:** January 15, 2025

**Problem Description:**
When switching between presets (e.g., "Full Resume" → "One-Page Resume"), the app completely freezes with Chrome's "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT.InvalidRequest" due to navigation throttling from infinite loop.

**What Works:**
- ✅ Preset dropdown UI displays correctly
- ✅ Preset data loads properly on server-side
- ✅ Individual preset configurations are valid
- ✅ First preset load works fine

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ Switching between any two presets causes infinite navigation loop
- ❌ Chrome detects rapid repeated navigation and blocks further requests
- ❌ App becomes completely unresponsive, requires page refresh
- ❌ Error: "ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT.InvalidRequest" in browser

**Root Cause Analysis:**
**Infinite Reactive Loop** between competing reactive statements in `+page.svelte`:

```javascript
// Statement 1: Handles preset data changes
$: if (data.availableSections) {
    handlePresetChange(data.availableSections, $sectionVisibilityStore) // Updates store
}

// Statement 2: Syncs sections back to URL  
$: if (mounted && Object.keys(visibleSections).length > 0) {
    updateSectionVisibility(visibleSections, $page.url, true) // Triggers navigation
}
```

**The Deadly Cycle:**
1. User clicks "One-Page Resume" → `navigateToPreset()` 
2. URL changes → Page reloads → `data.availableSections` changes
3. Statement 1 fires → `handlePresetChange()` updates `sectionVisibilityStore`
4. Store update triggers Statement 2 → `updateSectionVisibility()` 
5. URL navigation triggers another page reload
6. **INFINITE LOOP** → Chrome throttles → App freezes

**Failed Attempts:**
1. **Mount Guard** - Added `&& mounted` condition (broke app initialization)
2. **Preset Deduplication** - Track `lastProcessedPreset` (caused loading issues)
3. **Transition Guard** - Skip URL updates during preset transitions (complex, fragile)

**Next Approach:**
Need to **break the reactive cycle** by implementing **one-way data flow** during preset changes:
- Preset selection should only update URL
- URL change should only update stores  
- Store updates should NOT trigger URL changes during preset transitions
- Identify preset transition state to pause reactive URL syncing

### ✅ Production-Ready Features
