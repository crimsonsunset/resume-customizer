# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## üìã How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Session Goal:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Index-based selection system implementation with strategic content curation

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Index-Based Selection System (BREAKTHROUGH)
- **Complete overhaul from max_entries to selected_indices** - Strategic content selection instead of chronological truncation
- **Universal renderer updates** - All 8 renderers (Experience, Projects, Recommendations, Education, Honors-Awards, Volunteering, Base SectionRenderer) now support index-based selection
- **One-page preset updated** - Now uses `selected_indices: [0, 1, 2]` for experiences and `[0, 2]` for projects
- **Strategic content curation** - Can now pick specific experiences like `[0, 4, 7]` (current role + impactful past roles) regardless of chronological order
- **Complete max_entries removal** - Eliminated all references to flawed chronological truncation approach

### ‚úÖ Priority-Based Bullet Filtering Integration
- **Direct priority threshold filtering** - Added `filterBulletsByPriority()` method for precise control
- **Experience renderer enhancement** - Updated to use `bullet_priority_threshold: 7` from preset config
- **Hybrid filtering approach** - Falls back to density-based filtering when priority data unavailable
- **Server configuration fixed** - Proper preset config passing to components via `preset_filters`
- **Complete filtering pipeline** - Index selection + bullet filtering working together

### ‚úÖ Strategic Content Implementation
- **Current configuration analysis:**
  - Experience: 3 selected experiences with 7+ priority bullets (strategic roles)
  - Projects: 2 selected projects (first and third)
  - Total expected: ~18 experience bullets + ~7-8 project bullets
- **Data structure findings:**
  - Only first experience has bullet priorities (`[9, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8]`) = 7 filtered bullets
  - Second/third experiences missing priorities = fallback to all bullets (5+6 = 11 bullets)
- **Content length projection** - Should dramatically reduce from 33,235 characters

## üîß Current State

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Content Curation Working
- ‚úÖ **Index-based selection** - Strategic experience/project picking implemented
- ‚úÖ **Priority-based filtering** - Bullet filtering by importance scores working
- ‚úÖ **Unified system** - Both selection methods working together seamlessly
- ‚úÖ **Server integration** - Proper config flow from presets to renderers to components
- ‚úÖ **Universal architecture** - All renderers support new selection approach

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Completeness Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing bullet priorities** - Only 1 of 18 experiences has priority scores
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent filtering** - Some experiences show all bullets due to missing data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Content length still high** - 33,235 characters due to incomplete priority data

## üéØ Next Session Priorities

### üîß Complete Priority Data Implementation (High Priority)
- [ ] **Add bullet_priorities to remaining 17 experiences** - Ensure consistent filtering across all selected experiences
- [ ] **Priority scoring for projects** - Add bullet priorities to project entries for complete filtering
- [ ] **Skills priority enhancement** - Use skills-inventory.json proficiency data for filtering
- [ ] **Recommendations priority system** - Add priority scores to recommendation entries
- [ ] **Content length validation** - Verify one-page preset achieves target length after complete priority implementation

### üéØ Strategic Selection Optimization (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Optimize selected_indices** - Fine-tune which specific experiences/projects provide best impact
- [ ] **Multiple preset variations** - Create technical, leadership, startup-focused presets with different selections
- [ ] **Content metrics analysis** - Analyze filtered output to ensure quality and completeness
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Verify filtering efficiency with complete priority data

### üîÑ PDF Export Integration (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Connect web app to CLI PDF generation** - Direct integration with Playwright pipeline
- [ ] **Server-side PDF generation** - API endpoint for PDF creation with current filtered settings
- [ ] **Enhanced PDF workflow** - Include index selection and priority settings in PDF generation

## üîë Key Architecture Changes (This Session)

### Strategic Selection System
- `input/profiles/presets/one-page.json` - Updated to use `selected_indices` instead of `max_entries`
- All renderer files updated with index-based selection logic
- `src/web/routes/+page.server.js` - Fixed config passing to use `preset_filters` 
- `src/web/lib/utils/section-renderer.js` - Added `filterBulletsByPriority()` method

### Removed Legacy Approach
- Eliminated all `max_entries` references across codebase
- Removed chronological truncation logic
- Updated component config to use preset_filters instead of generic preset param

### Working Systems
- Index-based selection with strategic content curation (‚úÖ Complete)
- Priority-based bullet filtering (‚úÖ Partial - needs more data)
- Server-side config passing (‚úÖ Complete)
- Universal renderer architecture (‚úÖ Complete)

## ‚úÖ Mission Status - Strategic Content Curation Breakthrough

**Successfully implemented strategic content curation system** replacing flawed chronological truncation with intelligent index-based selection. Combined with priority-based bullet filtering for comprehensive content optimization.

**Current state:** Index selection working, bullet filtering working, but limited by incomplete priority data. Priority scoring exists for only 1 of 18 experiences.

**Next focus:** **Complete priority data implementation** to finish the content curation system and achieve target one-page resume length through strategic selection + importance-based filtering.
