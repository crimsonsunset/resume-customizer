# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## ðŸ“‹ How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Session Goal:** ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT** - Individual skills filtering and advanced preset variations

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

### âœ… Universal Density Filtering Complete
- **All 14 sections respond to density slider** - Experience, Projects, Activities, Skills, Recommendations, Courses, Certifications, Honors-Awards, Volunteering, Education, Headline, Summary, Objective, Location
- **Profile-based priority thresholds** - Clean configuration in profile.json with section-specific density requirements
- **Server-side filtering detection** - Intelligent tracking of actually visible sections after filtering
- **UI state synchronization** - Section checkboxes automatically sync with filtered content in density mode
- **Progressive resume condensation** - Sections disappear at appropriate density levels creating clean URL architecture
- **Debug logging system** - Comprehensive visibility into filtering decisions across all renderers

### âœ… Clean URL Architecture
- **Density mode** - Clean URLs with only density parameters (?density=80&mode=density)
- **Manual mode** - Section parameters for user control (?sections=head,sum,exp&mode=manual)
- **No conflicts** - Density filtering and manual section control work independently



## ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Priorities - Individual Skills Filtering & Advanced Optimization

### ðŸš€ Individual Skills Filtering (High Priority)
- [ ] **Skills Priority System** - Implement individual skill priorities within the 90-skill inventory
- [ ] **Skills Density Filtering** - Filter skills by importance/relevance rather than section-level hide/show
- [ ] **Skills Categorization** - Respect existing skill categories while applying density filtering
- [ ] **Progressive Skills Condensation** - Show most relevant skills first, filter out lower-priority ones

### ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Preset Variations (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Multi-Density Presets** - Create presets that combine section selection with specific density levels
- [ ] **Industry-Specific Variants** - Technical vs management vs startup-focused preset variations
- [ ] **Length-Targeted Presets** - Automatic density calculation for 1-page, 2-page, 3-page targets

### ðŸ”§ System Refinements (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Empty Section Detection** - All sections should hide completely when content gets filtered out
- [ ] **Section-Specific Logic** - Each section type needs appropriate filtering strategy
- [ ] **Uniform Response** - All sections should react proportionally to density changes
- [ ] **Testing & Validation** - Verify filtering works across all density levels

### ðŸ”„ Implementation Tasks (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Server Parameter Passing** - Add bulletDensity parameter to all section renderers
- [ ] **Renderer Updates** - Implement filtering logic in each renderer based on section data structure
- [ ] **Component Updates** - Ensure all Svelte components handle density parameter
- [ ] **Debug Implementation** - Add logging to verify filtering behavior

### ðŸŽ¨ Polish & Testing (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Ensure filtering doesn't slow down rendering
- [ ] **Visual Verification** - Test that sections look good at all density levels
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling** - What happens when all content in a section gets filtered
- [ ] **User Experience** - Smooth transitions and clear feedback on what's being filtered

## ðŸ”‘ Goal

Make the density slider affect ALL sections consistently - when you move the slider, every section should respond proportionally, not just the bullet-based ones.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Status - Universal Filtering Needed

**Partially completed density filtering.** Experience, Projects, and Activities sections respond correctly to density slider, but 7 other sections (Skills, Recommendations, Courses, Certifications, Honors & Awards, Volunteering, Education) remain static.

**Current state:** âœ… PARTIAL - Bullet-based sections working perfectly, empty detection functional, but non-bullet sections need filtering implementation.

**Next focus:** **Universal Density Filtering** to make ALL sections respond to the density slider for a consistent filtering experience across the entire resume.
