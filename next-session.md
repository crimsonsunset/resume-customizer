# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## 📋 How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Session Goal:** 🎯 **NEXT** - Universal density filtering for ALL sections

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ Partial Density Filtering Working
- **Bullet-based sections working** - Experience, Projects, Activities respond correctly to density slider
- **Empty detection confirmed** - Activities section disappears when all content filtered out  
- **Debug logging added** - Console output confirms filtering logic working as expected
- **System validation** - Filtering working perfectly for sections with bulletPoints arrays

### ❌ Static Sections Identified
- **Skills** - 90 skills, always renders same size (725 chars)
- **Recommendations** - 34 items (16 given, 18 received), always renders same size (24,826 chars)  
- **Courses** - 10 courses, always renders same size (956 chars)
- **Certifications** - 1 certification, always renders same size (322 chars)
- **Honors & Awards** - 2 awards, always renders same size (1,683 chars)
- **Volunteering** - 1 entry, always renders same size (1,090 chars)
- **Education** - 1 entry, always renders same size (346 chars)



## 🎯 Next Session Priorities - Universal Density Filtering

### 🚀 Make ALL Sections Respond to Density Slider (High Priority)
- [ ] **Skills Section Filtering** - Filter 90 skills based on importance/relevance at lower densities
- [ ] **Recommendations Section Filtering** - Filter 34 recommendations (given/received) by importance/length
- [ ] **Courses Section Filtering** - Filter 10 courses by relevance/level
- [ ] **Certifications Section Filtering** - Filter certifications by recency/importance  
- [ ] **Honors & Awards Section Filtering** - Filter awards by prestige/recency
- [ ] **Volunteering Section Filtering** - Filter volunteer experience by leadership/relevance
- [ ] **Education Section Filtering** - Show/hide education details based on density

### 🎯 Consistent Filtering Experience (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Empty Section Detection** - All sections should hide completely when content gets filtered out
- [ ] **Section-Specific Logic** - Each section type needs appropriate filtering strategy
- [ ] **Uniform Response** - All sections should react proportionally to density changes
- [ ] **Testing & Validation** - Verify filtering works across all density levels

### 🔄 Implementation Tasks (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Server Parameter Passing** - Add bulletDensity parameter to all section renderers
- [ ] **Renderer Updates** - Implement filtering logic in each renderer based on section data structure
- [ ] **Component Updates** - Ensure all Svelte components handle density parameter
- [ ] **Debug Implementation** - Add logging to verify filtering behavior

### 🎨 Polish & Testing (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Ensure filtering doesn't slow down rendering
- [ ] **Visual Verification** - Test that sections look good at all density levels
- [ ] **Edge Case Handling** - What happens when all content in a section gets filtered
- [ ] **User Experience** - Smooth transitions and clear feedback on what's being filtered

## 🔑 Goal

Make the density slider affect ALL sections consistently - when you move the slider, every section should respond proportionally, not just the bullet-based ones.

## 🎯 Mission Status - Universal Filtering Needed

**Partially completed density filtering.** Experience, Projects, and Activities sections respond correctly to density slider, but 7 other sections (Skills, Recommendations, Courses, Certifications, Honors & Awards, Volunteering, Education) remain static.

**Current state:** ✅ PARTIAL - Bullet-based sections working perfectly, empty detection functional, but non-bullet sections need filtering implementation.

**Next focus:** **Universal Density Filtering** to make ALL sections respond to the density slider for a consistent filtering experience across the entire resume.
