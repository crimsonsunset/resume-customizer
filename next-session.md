# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## ðŸ“‹ How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Session Goal:** ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT** - Individual skills filtering and advanced preset variations

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

### âœ… Mobile Responsive Design Complete  
- **DaisyUI Drawer Implementation** - Mobile hamburger menu with smooth slide-out controls panel
- **Responsive Header Layout** - Full-width desktop header with max-width resume content
- **Mobile Touch Optimization** - Proper mobile navigation with hamburger/X icon toggle
- **DaisyUI Wrapper Components** - Consistent UI with Button, Toggle, Card, Badge, and Checkbox wrappers
- **Clean Component Architecture** - Removed index manifest, using direct imports throughout
- **Download Button Enhancement** - Primary filled variant with consistent styling and sizing

### âœ… Universal Density Filtering Complete
- **All 14 sections respond to density slider** - Experience, Projects, Activities, Skills, Recommendations, Courses, Certifications, Honors-Awards, Volunteering, Education, Headline, Summary, Objective, Location
- **Profile-based priority thresholds** - Clean configuration in profile.json with section-specific density requirements
- **Server-side filtering detection** - Intelligent tracking of actually visible sections after filtering
- **UI state synchronization** - Section checkboxes automatically sync with filtered content in density mode
- **Progressive resume condensation** - Sections disappear at appropriate density levels creating clean URL architecture
- **Debug logging system** - Comprehensive visibility into filtering decisions across all renderers

### âœ… Clean URL Architecture
- **Density mode** - Clean URLs with only density parameters (?density=80&mode=density)
- **Manual mode** - Section parameters for user control (?sections=head,sum,exp&mode=manual)
- **No conflicts** - Density filtering and manual section control work independently



## ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Priorities - Advanced Features & Optimization

### ðŸš€ Hierarchical State Resolution (High Priority)
- [ ] **Remove Mode Toggle** - Implement hierarchical state resolution (checkboxes > timeframe > density) 
- [ ] **Timeframe Filter Integration** - Add years-based experience filtering with dynamic calculation
- [ ] **Unified Control System** - All filtering controls work together without circular dependencies
- [ ] **URL State Simplification** - Remove mode parameter, use simple `?sections=exp,proj&timeframe=5&density=70`

### ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Preset Variations (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Multi-Density Presets** - Create presets that combine section selection with specific density levels
- [ ] **Industry-Specific Variants** - Technical vs management vs startup-focused preset variations
- [ ] **Length-Targeted Presets** - Automatic density calculation for 1-page, 2-page, 3-page targets
- [ ] **Role-Specific Priority Overrides** - Different bullet priorities for leadership vs technical presets

### ðŸ”§ System Refinements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Temporal Experience Filtering** - Filter experience/projects by recency (last N years)
- [ ] **Smart Recommendation Engine** - AI-powered content suggestions based on job descriptions
- [ ] **ATS Optimization** - Keyword density and formatting optimizations for applicant tracking systems
- [ ] **Enhanced PDF Export** - Server-side PDF generation with Netlify Functions integration

### ðŸŽ¨ Polish & Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Reduce bundle size and improve loading times
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** - Track which resume configurations perform best
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support** - Internationalization for global users
- [ ] **Custom CSS Themes** - User-created resume styling options beyond DaisyUI themes

### ðŸ”„ Technical Debt & Maintenance (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Lodash-es Migration** - Replace native JavaScript methods with lodash-es for consistency
- [ ] **TypeScript Integration** - Add TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Implement unit and integration tests for core functionality
- [ ] **Documentation Updates** - Keep all documentation current with latest features

## ðŸ”‘ Goal

Implement hierarchical state resolution to eliminate mode toggle complexity while adding timeframe filtering and maintaining system stability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Status - Ready for Advanced Features

**Core platform complete.** Universal density filtering, mobile responsive design, and DaisyUI wrapper components all implemented and working perfectly.

**Current state:** âœ… FOUNDATION COMPLETE - Platform ready for advanced features like hierarchical filtering, smart recommendations, and enhanced preset systems.

**Next focus:** **Hierarchical State Resolution** to remove mode toggle while adding timeframe filtering, followed by advanced preset variations and optimization features.
