# Resume Customizer - Session Summary

## ðŸ“‹ How to Update This Doc

**This is a working document that gets refreshed each session:**
1. **Wipe accomplished items** - Remove completed tasks and achievements
2. **Keep undone items** - Leave incomplete tasks for tracking purposes
3. **Add new priorities** - Include new tasks and blockers that emerge
4. **Update current state** - Reflect what's working vs what needs attention

**Key difference from roadmap.md:**
- **This file:** Working session notes, gets refreshed as tasks complete
- **Roadmap.md:** Permanent historical record, accumulates progress over time

**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Session Goal:** âœ… **COMPLETE** - Full bullet priority system implementation across all sections

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Accomplishments

### âœ… Complete Bullet Priority System Implementation (BREAKTHROUGH)
- **Baseline priorities across ALL sections** - Implemented bullet_priorities for all 39 entries (18 experience + 20 projects + 1 activities)
- **Generalist priority framework** - Developed universal ranking system (3-10 scale) for unknown audiences
- **Strategic ranking completion** - Revolutionary Impact (9-10), Strategic Leadership (8-9), Technical Excellence (7-8), Professional Competence (5-7), Routine Work (3-5)
- **System validation** - Density filtering now fully operational across all sections with bulletPoints arrays

### âœ… Priority Framework Documentation
