# Bullet Priority System Documentation

## Overview

The Resume Customizer uses a sophisticated bullet priority system to intelligently curate content based on density settings and preset configurations. This system ensures that the most impactful and relevant information surfaces first, regardless of the viewer's background or the position being targeted.

## Strategic Framework

### The Generalist Priority Challenge

The system must rank bullet points in a **generalist manner** because we don't know who's viewing the resume or what kind of position they're tailoring for. The audience could be:

- **Technical Recruiters** (looking for specific tech skills)
- **Engineering Managers** (focused on team leadership and technical depth)
- **C-Level Executives** (interested in business impact and strategic thinking)
- **Startup Founders** (seeking versatile, high-impact contributors)
- **Enterprise Directors** (evaluating scalability and process expertise)

### Universal Value Indicators

Based on Joe Sangiorgio's profile analysis, the priority framework emphasizes universally impressive achievements:

#### ðŸš€ Revolutionary Impact (Priority 9-10)
- **Acquisition catalysts** (CRM drove Jibeâ†’iCIMS acquisition)
- **Award-winning products** (Stevie Award, Webby Award recognition)
- **AI pioneering** (early adoption when technology was "in its infancy")
- **Industry firsts** (first-of-kind implementations)
- **Company-defining moments** (product launches, major acquisitions)

#### ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Leadership (Priority 8-9)
- **Team scaling** (junior devs â†’ high-performing teams)
- **Process transformation** (removing bottlenecks, enabling velocity)
- **Technology adoption** (introducing new paradigms)
- **Business-critical systems** (enterprise infrastructure, production systems)
- **Cross-functional collaboration** (working across departments)

#### âš¡ Technical Excellence (Priority 7-8)
- **Architecture decisions** (system design, scalability solutions)
- **Performance optimization** (measurable improvements)
- **Complex integrations** (multiple systems, APIs, data flows)
- **Innovation implementation** (novel technical approaches)
- **Quality assurance** (testing, reliability, maintainability)

#### ðŸ”§ Professional Competence (Priority 5-7)
- **Feature development** (standard product work)
- **Bug fixes and maintenance** (keeping systems running)
- **Documentation and knowledge sharing**
- **Code reviews and mentoring**
- **Standard technical implementations**

#### ðŸ“‹ Routine Responsibilities (Priority 3-5)
- **Meeting participation**
- **Basic coding tasks**
- **Administrative duties**
- **Standard process following**

## Technical Implementation

### Current Architecture

#### Data Flow
```
Profile JSON â†’ Preset Overrides â†’ Density Filtering â†’ Rendered Content
```

#### Priority Resolution Order
1. **Preset bullet_priorities_overrides** (highest precedence)
2. **Base JSON bullet_priorities** (fallback)
3. **Default threshold filtering** (when no priorities exist)

### Supported Sections

Currently implemented bullet priority filtering:

- âœ… **Experience** (`experience-renderer.js`)
- âœ… **Projects** (`projects-renderer.js`)
- âœ… **Activities** (`activities-renderer.js`)

### Priority Override System

#### Preset-Level Overrides

Presets can override bullet priorities for specific entries:

```json
{
  "experience": {
    "selected_indices": [0, 1, 2],
    "bullet_priority_threshold": 7,
    "bullet_priorities_overrides": {
      "0": [10, 9, 10, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7],
      "1": [10, 7, 7, 9, 8],
      "2": [9, 10, 7, 7, 7, 8]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Cases for Overrides

- **Role-Specific Emphasis**: Leadership preset emphasizes management bullets
- **Industry Targeting**: Startup preset prioritizes growth and innovation
- **Experience Level**: Senior preset highlights strategic over tactical work
- **Geographic Preferences**: European preset might emphasize certain compliance aspects

### Implementation Details

#### filterBulletsWithConfig Function

Located in section renderers (`experience-renderer.js`, etc.):

```javascript
/**
 * Filters bullets based on priorities and threshold
 * @param {Array} bullets - Array of bullet point strings
 * @param {Array} priorities - Priority scores (1-10)
 * @param {number} threshold - Minimum priority to include
 * @returns {Array} Filtered bullets above threshold
 */
```

#### Priority Application Logic

1. Check for preset `bullet_priorities_overrides` for specific entry index
2. Fall back to base JSON `bullet_priorities` if no override
3. If no priorities exist, include all bullets (no filtering)
4. Apply threshold filtering based on density settings
