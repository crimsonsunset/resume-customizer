# Bullet Priority System Documentation

## Overview

The Resume Customizer uses a sophisticated bullet priority system to intelligently curate content based on density settings and preset configurations. This system ensures that the most impactful and relevant information surfaces first, regardless of the viewer's background or the position being targeted.

## Strategic Framework

### The Generalist Priority Challenge

The system must rank bullet points in a **generalist manner** because we don't know who's viewing the resume or what kind of position they're tailoring for. The audience could be:

- **Technical Recruiters** (looking for specific tech skills)
- **Engineering Managers** (focused on team leadership and technical depth)
- **C-Level Executives** (interested in business impact and strategic thinking)
- **Startup Founders** (seeking versatile, high-impact contributors)
- **Enterprise Directors** (evaluating scalability and process expertise)

### Universal Value Indicators

Based on Joe Sangiorgio's profile analysis, the priority framework emphasizes universally impressive achievements:

#### ðŸš€ Revolutionary Impact (Priority 9-10)
- **Acquisition catalysts** (CRM drove Jibeâ†’iCIMS acquisition)
- **Award-winning products** (Stevie Award, Webby Award recognition)
- **AI pioneering** (early adoption when technology was "in its infancy")
- **Industry firsts** (first-of-kind implementations)
- **Company-defining moments** (product launches, major acquisitions)

#### ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Leadership (Priority 8-9)
- **Team scaling** (junior devs â†’ high-performing teams)
- **Process transformation** (removing bottlenecks, enabling velocity)
- **Technology adoption** (introducing new paradigms)
- **Business-critical systems** (enterprise infrastructure, production systems)
- **Cross-functional collaboration** (working across departments)

#### âš¡ Technical Excellence (Priority 7-8)
- **Architecture decisions** (system design, scalability solutions)
- **Performance optimization** (measurable improvements)
- **Complex integrations** (multiple systems, APIs, data flows)
- **Innovation implementation** (novel technical approaches)
- **Quality assurance** (testing, reliability, maintainability)

#### ðŸ”§ Professional Competence (Priority 5-7)
- **Feature development** (standard product work)
- **Bug fixes and maintenance** (keeping systems running)
- **Documentation and knowledge sharing**
- **Code reviews and mentoring**
- **Standard technical implementations**

#### ðŸ“‹ Routine Responsibilities (Priority 3-5)
- **Meeting participation**
- **Basic coding tasks**
- **Administrative duties**
- **Standard process following**

## Technical Implementation

### Current Architecture

#### Data Flow
```
Profile JSON â†’ Preset Overrides â†’ Density Filtering â†’ Rendered Content
```

#### Priority Resolution Order
1. **Preset bullet_priorities_overrides** (highest precedence)
2. **Base JSON bullet_priorities** (fallback)
3. **Default threshold filtering** (when no priorities exist)

### Supported Sections

Currently implemented bullet priority filtering:

- âœ… **Experience** (`experience-renderer.js`)
- âœ… **Projects** (`projects-renderer.js`)
- âœ… **Activities** (`activities-renderer.js`)

### Priority Override System

#### Preset-Level Overrides

Presets can override bullet priorities for specific entries:

```json
{
  "experience": {
    "selected_indices": [0, 1, 2],
    "bullet_priority_threshold": 7,
    "bullet_priorities_overrides": {
      "0": [10, 9, 10, 8, 7, 6, 6, 7],
      "1": [10, 7, 7, 9, 8],
      "2": [9, 10, 7, 7, 7, 8]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Cases for Overrides

- **Role-Specific Emphasis**: Leadership preset emphasizes management bullets
- **Industry Targeting**: Startup preset prioritizes growth and innovation
- **Experience Level**: Senior preset highlights strategic over tactical work
- **Geographic Preferences**: European preset might emphasize certain compliance aspects

### Implementation Details

#### filterBulletsWithConfig Function

Located in section renderers (`experience-renderer.js`, etc.):

```javascript
/**
 * Filters bullets based on priorities and threshold
 * @param {Array} bullets - Array of bullet point strings
 * @param {Array} priorities - Priority scores (1-10)
 * @param {number} threshold - Minimum priority to include
 * @returns {Array} Filtered bullets above threshold
 */
```

#### Priority Application Logic

1. Check for preset `bullet_priorities_overrides` for specific entry index
2. Fall back to base JSON `bullet_priorities` if no override
3. If no priorities exist, include all bullets (no filtering)
4. Apply threshold filtering based on density settings

## Section-Level Density Filtering

In addition to bullet-level priorities, the system implements section-level density filtering to create progressive resume condensation. This operates independently from bullet priorities and controls entire section visibility based on density thresholds.

### Section Priority Configuration

Sections are configured in `profile.json` under `resume_config.section_priorities` with priority values that determine visibility thresholds:

```json
{
  "section_priorities": {
    "headline": 4,           // Hide after 40% density
    "summary": 8,            // Hide after 80% density  
    "objective": 9,          // Hide after 90% density
    "certifications": 9,     // Hide after 90% density
    "courses": 9,            // Hide after 90% density
    "activities": 5,         // Hide after 50% density
    "recommendations": 3,    // Hide after 30% density
    "volunteering": 7,       // Hide after 70% density
    "honors-awards": 7       // Hide after 70% density
  }
}
```

**Formula:** `priority Ã— 10 = density threshold percentage`

### Section Filtering Strategy

- **Always Visible:** Education, Skills, Experience, Projects (core resume content)
- **High Threshold (90%):** Objective, Certifications, Courses (credential-focused)
- **Medium Threshold (70-80%):** Summary, Volunteering, Honors-Awards (supporting content)
- **Lower Threshold (30-50%):** Activities, Recommendations (nice-to-have content)
- **Minimal Threshold (40%):** Headline (space optimization only)

### Progressive Condensation

As density decreases, sections disappear in strategic order:
1. **100% â†’ 90%:** Objective, Certifications, Courses disappear
2. **90% â†’ 80%:** Summary disappears  
3. **80% â†’ 70%:** Volunteering, Honors-Awards disappear
4. **70% â†’ 50%:** Activities disappear
5. **50% â†’ 40%:** Headline disappears
6. **40% â†’ 30%:** Recommendations disappear

This creates a natural content hierarchy that preserves the most essential information while allowing aggressive space optimization for specific use cases.

## Skills Priority + Market Demand Sorting System

### Overview

The skills section implements a sophisticated dual-weighting system that combines **generalist priority rankings** with **real-world market demand** to intelligently order skills within each category bucket. This ensures the most universally valuable and in-demand skills appear first.

### Mathematical Sorting Formula

```javascript
sortScore = (priority Ã— 0.6) + (marketDemand Ã— 0.4)
```

**Weighting Rationale:**
- **60% Priority Weight**: Emphasizes our strategic generalist rankings
- **40% Market Demand Weight**: Factors in real-world job market demand
- **Descending Sort**: Highest scores appear first within each category

### Skills Categorization System

Skills are organized into 6 strategic buckets with intelligent context-based categorization:

#### 1. **Leadership** (Highest Priority)
- Team Management, Cross-team Collaboration, Technical Leadership
- **Context Triggers**: `['leadership', 'management', 'business', 'product']`

#### 2. **Programming Languages** (Core Foundation)  
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, HTML, CSS/Sass, SQL, etc.
- **Identification**: Exact name matching against curated language list
- **Context Triggers**: `['javascript', 'css']` for fallback categorization

#### 3. **Frameworks & Libraries** (Technical Stack)
- React, Express, Jest, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, etc.
- **Context Triggers**: `['frontend', 'backend', 'mobile', 'nodejs', 'testing']`

#### 4. **Tools & Platforms** (DevOps & Infrastructure)
- Git, Docker, AWS, VS Code, npm, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Context Triggers**: `['devops', 'cms', 'analytics', 'logging', 'monitoring', 'configuration', 'productivity', 'system']`

#### 5. **Concepts & Methodologies** (Process & Architecture)
- Agile, Scrum, CI/CD, REST APIs, Microservices, TDD, etc.
- **Context Triggers**: `['development', 'api', 'data', 'design', 'ai', 'crypto', 'performance', 'security', 'technical', 'marketing', 'education']`

#### 6. **Operating Systems** (Special Handling)
- Hardcoded: "Proficient in Windows, Mac, or Linux, Android and iOS"
- **Visibility**: Only appears at â‰¥80% density (senior/focused resumes)
- **Positioning**: Always renders last when visible

### Priority + Market Demand Scale

Both priority and marketDemand use 1-10 scales:

#### **Priority 10 - Universal Foundation** (Score ~10.0)
- **JavaScript**: priority 10, marketDemand 10 â†’ **10.0**
- **Git**: priority 10, marketDemand 10 â†’ **10.0**
- **HTML**: priority 10, marketDemand 10 â†’ **10.0**
- **SQL**: priority 10, marketDemand 10 â†’ **10.0**

#### **Priority 9 - Critical Generalist Core** (Score ~9.4)
- **React**: priority 9, marketDemand 10 â†’ **9.4**
- **Node.js**: priority 9, marketDemand 9 â†’ **9.0**
- **TypeScript**: priority 8, marketDemand 9 â†’ **8.4**

#### **Priority 8 - Highly Valuable** (Score ~8.0-8.4)
- **Express**: priority 8, marketDemand 8 â†’ **8.0**
- **AWS**: priority 8, marketDemand 9 â†’ **8.4**
- **Docker**: priority 8, marketDemand 8 â†’ **8.0**

#### **Priority 7-6 - Strong Foundation** (Score ~6.0-7.0)
- **Python**: priority 7, marketDemand 8 â†’ **7.4**
- **MongoDB**: priority 8, marketDemand 6 â†’ **7.2**
- **Redux**: priority 7, marketDemand 6 â†’ **6.6**

#### **Priority 5-3 - Specialized Skills** (Score ~3.0-5.0)
- **Webpack**: priority 6, marketDemand 4 â†’ **5.2**
- **Lodash**: priority 5, marketDemand 3 â†’ **4.2**
- **WebSockets**: priority 5, marketDemand 4 â†’ **4.2**

#### **Priority 2-1 - Niche/Declining** (Score ~1.0-2.0)
- **jQuery**: priority 4, marketDemand 2 â†’ **3.2**
- **Bulma**: priority 3, marketDemand 2 â†’ **2.6**
- **auth0**: priority 3, marketDemand 3 â†’ **3.0**

### Skills Filtering Integration

The skills section integrates with the density filtering system:

```javascript
// Calculate priority threshold - inverted so higher density shows more skills
// 100% density â†’ threshold 1 (show all), 10% density â†’ threshold 10 (show only highest)
const priorityThreshold = Math.ceil((110 - bulletDensity) / 10)
```

**Filtering Behavior:**
- **100% density**: Shows all skills (priority â‰¥ 1)
- **90% density**: Shows priority â‰¥ 2 skills  
- **80% density**: Shows priority â‰¥ 3 skills + Operating Systems appears
- **10% density**: Shows only priority â‰¥ 10 skills (most universal)

### Implementation Details

#### Core Sorting Function

Located in `src/web/lib/utils/skills-renderer.js`:

```javascript
// Sort skills within each category by priority + market demand
for (const category of Object.keys(categories)) {
  categories[category].sort((skillA, skillB) => {
    const skillDataA = this.getSkillData(skillsInventory, skillA)
    const skillDataB = this.getSkillData(skillsInventory, skillB)
    
    // Calculate weighted sort scores (priority 60%, market demand 40%)
    const scoreA = (skillDataA.priority * 0.6) + (skillDataA.marketDemand * 0.4)
    const scoreB = (skillDataB.priority * 0.6) + (skillDataB.marketDemand * 0.4)
    
    // Sort descending (highest score first)
    return scoreB - scoreA
  })
}
```

#### Market Demand Data Structure

Skills inventory (`input/profiles/skills-inventory.json`) includes both fields:

```json
{
  "javascript": {
    "name": "JavaScript",
    "priority": 10,
    "marketDemand": 10,
    "contexts": ["javascript"]
  },
  "react": {
    "name": "React", 
    "priority": 9,
    "marketDemand": 10,
    "contexts": ["frontend", "spa"]
  }
}
```

#### Debug Logging System

The system provides comprehensive debug output showing sorting calculations:

```
ðŸ”¢ Programming Languages top skills: JavaScript(10.0), HTML(10.0), SQL(10.0)
ðŸ”¢ Frameworks & Libraries top skills: React(9.4), Express(8.0), Jest(7.0)
ðŸ”¢ Tools & Platforms top skills: Git(10.0), AWS(8.4), Docker(8.0)
```

### Customization Guide

#### Adjusting Skill Order

To modify skill ordering within buckets:

1. **Increase Priority**: Boost universally important skills (1-10 scale)
2. **Adjust Market Demand**: Reflect current job market trends (1-10 scale)
3. **Fine-tune Weights**: Modify the 0.6/0.4 ratio in sorting function if needed

#### Adding New Skills

1. Add skill to `skills-inventory.json` with appropriate:
   - `priority` (1-10 based on generalist importance)
   - `marketDemand` (1-10 based on job market demand)
   - `contexts` (for proper categorization)

2. Skills automatically categorize based on context mapping and appear in sorted order

#### Market Demand Guidelines

- **10**: Universally demanded (JavaScript, React, Git)
- **9**: Highly sought after (TypeScript, AWS, Python)
- **8**: Strong market presence (Docker, PostgreSQL)
- **7**: Solid demand (Jest, MongoDB)
- **6**: Moderate demand (Redis, Angular)
- **5**: Niche but valuable (Webpack, Next.js)
- **4**: Specialized tools (WebSockets, GraphQL)
- **3**: Declining or very niche (jQuery, Bulma)
- **2**: Legacy or limited use (Flash, FTP)
- **1**: Obsolete or extremely niche

### Strategic Benefits

#### **For Technical Recruiters**
- Most demanded technologies appear first
- Clear skill categorization for quick scanning
- Progressive filtering for different seniority levels

#### **For Engineering Managers**  
- Leadership skills prominently featured at top
- Technical depth clearly organized by category
- Balance of technical and soft skills

#### **For C-Level Executives**
